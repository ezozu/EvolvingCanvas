# EvolvingCanvas: Decentralized NFT Marketplace

*Interoperable smart contracts leveraging on-chain metadata aggregation for fractionalized ownership and automated liquidity provisioning.*

## Detailed Description

EvolvingCanvas is a decentralized NFT marketplace built to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient platform for trading digital assets. Unlike traditional NFT marketplaces, EvolvingCanvas focuses on enabling fractionalized ownership of NFTs, allowing users to own and trade portions of high-value digital collectibles. This democratizes access to valuable NFTs, making them more accessible to a wider audience. The core of EvolvingCanvas is built upon a set of interoperable smart contracts deployed on a compatible blockchain network, written in Go and compiled to bytecode for execution on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or similar environments.

A key innovation within EvolvingCanvas is its on-chain metadata aggregation system. This system allows for the dynamic collection and validation of NFT metadata from various sources, ensuring data integrity and minimizing reliance on centralized metadata storage solutions. By consolidating metadata on-chain, EvolvingCanvas minimizes the risk of metadata manipulation and provides a more reliable and transparent foundation for NFT valuation and trading. The aggregated metadata is used to inform automated liquidity provisioning mechanisms, facilitating efficient and fair trading of fractionalized NFTs.

Furthermore, EvolvingCanvas incorporates automated liquidity provisioning (ALP) through integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXes) like Uniswap or PancakeSwap. The ALP system utilizes the on-chain metadata and real-time market data to dynamically adjust liquidity pools, ensuring sufficient liquidity for fractionalized NFT trading. This automated approach reduces the need for manual intervention and improves the overall efficiency of the marketplace. EvolvingCanvas aims to be a cutting-edge platform for the evolution of NFT trading and ownership, fostering a vibrant and accessible ecosystem for digital collectibles.

## Key Features

*   **Fractionalized NFT Ownership:** Enables users to own and trade portions of NFTs. Each NFT is divisible into ERC-20 tokens representing fractional ownership. The ratio is defined at the time of fractionalization.
*   **On-Chain Metadata Aggregation:** Dynamically collects and validates NFT metadata from various sources on-chain. A dedicated contract handles metadata fetching and verification through a pre-defined schema.
*   **Automated Liquidity Provisioning:** Integrates with DEXes for automated liquidity management. The smart contract interacts with DEX AMMs to create and manage liquidity pools for fractionalized NFTs.
*   **Interoperable Smart Contracts:** Modular and interoperable smart contracts written in Go and compiled to EVM bytecode using a Go-Ethereum binding. Each contract is designed to interact seamlessly with others in the system.
*   **Secure and Transparent Transactions:** Leveraging the security and transparency of the blockchain, all transactions are recorded on-chain and publicly verifiable. Contract security is enforced through rigorous auditing and formal verification.
*   **Decentralized Governance (Future Roadmap):** Planned implementation of a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for community governance and platform upgrades. DAO members will vote on important protocol decisions.
*   **API Integration:** Provides a comprehensive API for developers to build applications and services on top of the EvolvingCanvas platform. The API supports functionalities like NFT listing, fractionalization, trading, and metadata retrieval.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go:** Programming language used for developing the smart contracts (compiled to EVM bytecode) and backend services. Gos concurrency model and efficient execution make it ideal for blockchain applications.
*   **Ethereum (or compatible blockchain):** The underlying blockchain network for deploying the smart contracts. We currently support Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.
*   **Solidity (Optional):** Solidity may be used for smaller helper contracts or for interacting with existing Solidity-based contracts.
*   **Go-Ethereum (Geth):** Go implementation of the Ethereum protocol, used for interacting with the blockchain. Facilitates smart contract deployment, execution, and event monitoring.
*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Decentralized storage system for storing NFT metadata and assets. Ensures data availability and censorship resistance.
*   **The Graph (Optional):** Decentralized indexing protocol for querying blockchain data. Used for efficiently retrieving and displaying NFT information.
*   **gRPC:** High-performance, open-source universal RPC framework. Utilized for communication between backend services and external clients.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Go (version 1.18 or later)
    *   Docker (for running local blockchain nodes)
    *   Git
    *   Node.js and npm (for frontend development, if applicable)

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/ezozu/EvolvingCanvas.git
    cd EvolvingCanvas

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    go mod download
    go mod tidy

4.  **Set up a local blockchain node (using Ganache or similar):**
    (Consider using a Docker image for a pre-configured environment. Consult the documentation for Ganache-cli or Hardhat for setup instructions.)

5.  **Compile the smart contracts:**
    Run the compilation script, which uses the Go compiler to create EVM bytecode.
    ./scripts/compile_contracts.sh

6.  **Deploy the smart contracts:**
    Use a deployment script to deploy the compiled smart contracts to your local blockchain node. Ensure your node is running before executing the script. The script requires the address of a funded account to pay gas fees.
    ./scripts/deploy_contracts.sh <private_key> <network_id>

## Configuration

The EvolvingCanvas smart contracts and backend services rely on environment variables for configuration.

*   `BLOCKCHAIN_RPC_URL`: The URL of the blockchain RPC endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8545`).
*   `CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the deployed EvolvingCanvas smart contract.
*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the account used for deploying and interacting with the smart contracts. **Important: Never commit your private key to a public repository.**
*   `IPFS_GATEWAY_URL`: The URL of the IPFS gateway used for retrieving NFT metadata.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The connection string for the database used by backend services (if applicable).

These environment variables can be set using `.env` files or by directly setting them in your terminal.

## Usage

After deploying the smart contracts, you can interact with them using the Go-Ethereum library or through a web3 interface.

**Example (Go):**

package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
)

func main() {
	client, err := ethclient.Dial("http://localhost:8545")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	// Use the client to interact with the deployed contracts.
	// Replace "contractAddress" with the actual contract address.
	// contractAddress := common.HexToAddress("0x...")
	// ...
	fmt.Println("Connected to Ethereum node.")
	client.Close()
}

**API Documentation:**

A comprehensive API documentation is available at [link to API documentation]. This documentation provides detailed information on all API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. It includes examples of how to use the API for tasks such as listing NFTs, fractionalizing NFTs, trading fractionalized tokens, and retrieving NFT metadata.
